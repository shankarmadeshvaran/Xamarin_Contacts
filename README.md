# Xamarin_Contacts
Contacts is a sample Application which I developed while learning Xamarin Forms. I developed this project in MVVM architecture and can be able to run in both iOS and Android devices.I have used SQLite local Database and imlpemented many more features. I think this project will help lot of new developers who started learning Xamarin development.

## Architecture
The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern helps to cleanly separate the business and presentation logic of an application from its user interface (UI). Maintaining a clean separation between application logic and the UI helps to address numerous development issues and can make an application easier to test, maintain, and evolve. It can also greatly improve code re-use opportunities and allows developers and UI designers to more easily collaborate when developing their respective parts of an app.
There are three core components in the MVVM pattern: the model, the view, and the view model. Each serves a distinct purpose.

## Issues
I'll constantly update this project whenever I find the great coding standards and better architecture. So when you came across any error or better method to do code , feel free to raise a issue or contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devinmaking)

## Enhancements
  ```
 In this project I have also implemented local database to this project and 
 pushed it into new repo named Xamarin_MVVM_ContactsBook. Go ahead and refer that 
 repository link which I mentioned below. I have implemented local database 
 SQLite and developed in MVVM architecture(Every features are fall under MVVM Pattern).
 Consider star the repo if you like it.Thanks

## More Updates
I'll constanly implement lot more features whenever something popup in my mind.Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shankar__am) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shankar-mathesh) to get the latest update about features, code and more. Consider star the repo if you like it.
